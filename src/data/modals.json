This landing view provides users with three main options to move forward, including a login and signup option. The third option is a code input intended for users that are invited by companies to rate interface mockups.</p><h3>User Workflows</h3><h4>User Testers</h4><p>After inputting a code, users are directed to a terms and conditions screen. Scrolling to the bottom of this screen populates accept and reject buttons. If accepted, users are guided comfortably through the testing features and input sections.</p><h4>Company Users</h4><p>After successful login and/or signup, this application displays a tab bar that navigates three main views. The first view is an interface designed for uploading the interface mockups. The second view displays any data and results from that company's A/B tests. The third view is designed to be a tool that generates codes for user testers and tracks their completion status. There is also a settings icon in the top right corner of the title header for users to access helpful tools and information at any point during a session.</p>",

Both of the signup and login screens can navigate back to the landing view by clicking on either the main title or logo icon.</p><p>If users sign up, they are greeted by an introduction modal personalized with their name. Currently, this is the only feedback interaction, but I intend on building more to guide users through the process of sharing their goals.</p><h3>UI Features</h3><p>Personal and starred goals sections are listed under the goal sharing section. Users have the option to mark their goals as completed by clicking on the checkmark icon to the right of each goal. Users can navigate the application via the tab bar that 1) fills in the clicked icon and 2) rotates that icon to the center of the bar. This is meant to help users identify exactly which view they are looking at. The best part about this prototype is the vertical search bar displayed in the search view. It provides users with options to search a keyword or click on category icons, which are the same set of icons that must be selected before sharing a goal.</p>",

Although the product doesn't look like the artboard slides, I learned so much from this process of collaborating with other individuals. Not everything can be implemented within a specific timeframe, and some things will be scratched completely because they may not align with a company vision. This is a valuable process that I have no hard feelings for.</p><p>There are still a few similarities between this mockup and the built-out product. The first is the landing view that includes both sign in and sign up components in one place, so users don't have to navigate between views to do either. The second is the navbar that is displayed once users are redirected internally, which features a \"new post\" button. This allows users to post at any point during a session. The final similarity is the filtering option for ski, snowboard and soft goods. The core filtering functionality is there with some added options in the built-out product.</p>",

This prototype isn't intended to behave like a normal web application. That being said, several feedback interactions must be built in to guide users throughout the application and to avoid mass amounts of confusion and frustration. This instruction and feedback would be activated for writers, agents and publishers that have recently registered.</p><h3>UI Features</h3><p>The idea is to have users navigate via the circular buttons and bold words. The buttons open and close modal extensions. Clicking on bold words will either save the state of data in an extension, or direct users to a new section/portal. After login and signup, pen names are displayed in the center of the main \"plus sign\" modal. If users navigate to a new section, the title of that section is then listed in the center.</p>",
